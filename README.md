# Income Division Desktop App Developed with Rust and Slint


## Use of application 

I developed this application to streamline the process of allocating my income to various monthly expenses, making the task of budgeting and expenditure management more convenient.

## Reason for Development 
I chose to enhance my Rust programming skills by embarking on a practical project that fulfilled a real-world need. Inspired by a tutorial by Travis Media on YouTube ([link to the video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aFgeUG9TK4&t=1233s)), I took on the challenge of building the application and expanding my expertise in Rust.

## Technology use
* Rust Programming Language (or the core logic of the code)
* Slint (For the User Interface)

## Installation

1. **Install Rust**: Ensure that you have Rust installed on your system. You can download and install Rust by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal and run the following command:

   `git clone <https://github.com/LexusG/incomeapp.git>`

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the root directory of the cloned project:

   `cd <project-directory>`

    Replace <project-directory> with the name of the directory where the project was cloned.
## Usage
1. **Build the Application**: Run the following command to build the Rust application:
`cargo build --release`
This command will compile the application in release mode.

2. **Run the Application**: After the build process completes successfully, you can run the application using the following command:
`cargo run --release`
This command will execute the application.

3. **Interact with the Application**: Once the application is running, follow the on-screen instructions provided by the Slint-based user interface to allocate your income to various monthly expenses.

4. **Exit the Application**: To exit the application, follow the instructions provided within the application's interface or simply close the application window.

## Additional Notes
**Dependencies**: Ensure that all dependencies required by the application are installed properly. You can find information about dependencies in the project's Cargo.toml file.
