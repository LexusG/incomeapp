# Income Division Desktop App Developed with Rust and Slint


## Use of application 

I developed this application to streamline the process of allocating my income to various monthly expenses, making the task of budgeting and expenditure management more convenient.

## Reason for Development 
I chose to enhance my Rust programming skills by embarking on a practical project that fulfilled a real-world need. Inspired by a tutorial by Travis Media on YouTube ([link to the video used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aFgeUG9TK4&t=1233s)), I took on the challenge of building the application and expanding my expertise in Rust.

## Technology use
* Rust Programming Language (or the core logic of the code)
* Slint (For the User Interface)
